        Copyright 2018. \n\n<b>Scoring Methodologies:</b> \n\nFor Minesweeper, the score of the player is determined
        as a ratio of the number of mines to the total elapsed time of the game, with a level multiplier
        applied. The multiplier is 1 for easy, 2 for medium, and 3 for hard. An additional multiplier of 4 is applied
        to all scores, and then floor rounding is applied to the resulting score. The 3BV score of the board instance
        is not calculated. \n\nBoggle is scored according to traditional rules: \n<ul><li>Words with fewer than
        3 letters do not earn any points.</li>\n<li>3 or 4 letters: 1 point</li>\n<li>5 letters: 2 points</li>\n<li>6
        letters: 3 points</li>\n<li>7 letters: 5 points</li>\n<li>8+ letters: 11 points</li>\n<li>The "Qu" letter
        combination counts as two letters.</li>\n<li>Repeated words are not counted towards the score, even if
        they are composed from a different distinct combination of tiles.</li></ul>\n\n

        <a href="https://github.com/MissElle" target="_blank">@MissElle</a> was kind enough to offer UI feedback.
        <a href="https://github.com/mchorton" target="_blank">@mchorton</a> was kind enough to ooh and ahh when
        requested. The Boggle implementation would not have been possible without an existing "dictionary" of
        English language words; this implementation uses <a href="https://github.com/dwyl/english-words" target="_blank">this repo
        </a> and credit goes to <a href="https://dwyl.com/">DWYL</a> for making the dictionary publicly
        available. Cheers!
