        Copyright 2018. \n\n<b>Scoring Methodologies:</b> \n\nFor Minesweeper, the score of the player is determined
        as a ratio of the number of mines to the total elapsed time of the game, with a level multiplier
        applied. The multiplier is 1 for easy, 2 for medium, and 3 for hard. An additional multiplier of 4 is applied
        to all scores, and then floor rounding is applied to the resulting score. The 3BV score of the board instance
        is not calculated. \n\nBoggle is scored according to traditional rules:
